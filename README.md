this is my first try to build TWRP please forgive me :

based on https://github.com/cooked71/device_realme_RMX3834_twrp/tree/main from gitFASTBOOT (is the nearest devtree found)
from scratch

we have shell,logs,external_sd, but no twrp ui, no data decrypt, gatekepeer set to 4.x (on recovery.log), and android.health,
still need to cleanup useless stuff

built using twrp minimal manifest 12.1

bootloader was unlocked using https://github.com/TomKing062/CVE-2022-38694_unlock_bootloader/wiki/SupportList
